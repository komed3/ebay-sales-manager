# eBay Sales Manager

Managing private eBay orders helps you track sales, profits, and customer data. The system supports the export of reports and statistics, provides insight into detailed sales data, and offers a map view of all customer locations.

New orders can be entered quickly and easily using the form. Reports and statistics help you keep track of sales and profits and are generated automatically by the system. A filterable list of all orders makes it easy to manage and track sales, while the map view visualizes orders by location.
